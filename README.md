# NatixisUnofficialAPI
Unofficial python API for Natixis Interepargne accounts


More than an "alfa" version, I just need some feedbacks on the data retrieved by the module natixis.connections.DataRetriever.

Please try to play with the main.py file, just insert your credentials in the pre-set variables, save it and launch it:
python main.py

!! Do not forget to remove your credentials from the main.py file  and re-save it!!

Any feedback + contribution is more than welcome
